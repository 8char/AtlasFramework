# Atlas Library

Atlas Library is a framework developed specifically for Garry's Mod, with the goal of making mundane tasks easier and more interconnected. This means that you can use the library to quickly and easily perform common tasks in your Garry's Mod projects, without having to write everything from scratch.

But that's not all - the library is open-source, so if you want to improve it or add new features, you can simply fork the repository and make a pull request. This way, the entire community can benefit from your contributions, and the library will continue to grow and evolve.

## Getting Started

1. Install [LAUX](https://gitlab.com/sleeppyy/laux#how-to-use)
    - LAUX is a superset of Lua, it will transpile your files down to lua. Basically all LAUX does is adds syntactic sugar.
2. Navigate to your addons folder, and open a terminal/command prompt inside of the file.
3. Clone the library by running `git clone https://github.com/8char/AtlasLibrary.git && cd AtlasLibrary`
4. Run the `transpile.bat` file!
    - When the console stops printing lines, it should be fully compiled.

## Credits

This repository is a fork of XeninUI, a popular user interface framework for Garry's Mod. While XeninUI has largely been abandoned, this fork aims to improve upon the documentation and the framework as a whole.

By updating the documentation and fixing any lingering bugs or issues, we hope to make XeninUI more accessible and usable for the Garry's Mod community. We also plan to add new features and functionality to the framework, making it even more powerful and useful for developers.

So if you're a fan of XeninUI, be sure to check out this fork and see all the improvements we've made. And if you want to contribute to the project, we welcome any and all pull requests! Together, we can make XeninUI even better than it already is.
