## Getting Started


1. Install [LAUX](https://gitlab.com/sleeppyy/laux#how-to-use)
    - LAUX is a superset of Lua, it will transpile your files down to lua. Basically all LAUX does is adds syntactic sugar.
2. Navigate to your addons folder, and open a terminal/command prompt inside of the file.
3. Clone the library by running `git clone https://github.com/8char/AtlasLibrary.git && cd AtlasLibrary`
4. Run the `transpile.bat` file!
    - When the console stops printing lines, it should be fully compiled.
