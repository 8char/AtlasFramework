AtlasLoader is designed to make developing addons simple. It's made so that you don't ever need to focus on creating your own loaders ever again whilst preventing it from polluting the global [namespace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Namespace) ([_G](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/Global_Variables)).
